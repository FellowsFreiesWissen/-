# Collaborative Citizen Science: Creating Linked Open Ogham Data with Wikidata

## Abstract eingereicht als talk bei [EAA 2021](https://www.e-a-a.org/eaa2021)

Ogham Stones are monoliths inscribed with the Ogham script, erected mostly between the 4th and 6th century in Ireland and the Western British Isles. The standard work on Ogham inscriptions is the Corpus Inscriptionum Insularum Celticarum (CIIC) (Macálister 1945). Additional print publications and online databases from different scientific projects (e. g. Celtic Inscribed Stones Project: CISP) exist. However, these data sets are not technically interlinked, so that overarching research is cumbersome. In this talk, we will focus on the Wikimedia Germany Open Science Fellow Program funded project `Irish ᚑᚌᚆᚐᚋ Stones in the Wikimedia Universe` (<http://ogham.squirrel.link>). In collaboration with the Wikimedia fellow project `Acceleration of quality in the humanities` (<http://quality.squirrel.link>), we are also dedicated to reflecting the project's systems to explore possible solutions for the reproduction of as of yet undetected incorrect data from historical publications into digital form. The Open Science Fellow Programme 2020/2021 aims particularly to highlight Knowledge Equity and chances of integrating volunteers and researchers into the scientific process, which are central to citizen science.

To enable joint research, we import data from established scientific databases (CIIC, CISP) into Wikidata as a secondary database, which will also allow the citizen science community to engage with and enhance information.  In addition, we build an own Linked Open Data knowledge base as a primary source to allow further semantic modelling possibilities. Furthermore, the Wikidata data will be mirrored back to our own knowledge base, including a validation process, to gain an interactive flow between academia and citizen archaeologists´ data. Using this approach and bidirectional links, the quality, professional and technical control is shared between two stakeholders. In consequence, this approach will allow for the Ogham data to be openly available under Creative Commons licenses for scientific discourse and can be used for other non-academic purposes, e. g. Hackathons.
